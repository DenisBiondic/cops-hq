# Features

Cops-hq offers many features, and most can be used in isolation. For example, if you only wanted to write pure IaC scripts in Go, 
you can simply use the [Command Executor](02-command-execution.md) library. If you want a higher-level support with common tasks
already solved out of the box, you can use one of the recipes like [Terraform Recipe](09-terraform.md).

Note: all public exposed members are documented via GoDoc, so make sure you check the source code as well! Tests are also a nice
way to understand the features.
